# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction

A complete machine-learning workflow to predict laptop prices based on technical specifications. From data collection and cleaning to training regression models and deploying a simple web app interface.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model capable of estimating laptop prices from features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, GPU, and weight. It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and cleaning
- Model training
-  Model evaluation using R²
- A lightweight web app for live price prediction
